# musescore2pdf

Created to scan through Google Drive directories and convert Musescore files to PDFs as soon as they are created/updated.
To work, the connected directory needs the following structure:
```
arbitrary/path/
    song.mscz
    pdfs/
        song-guitar.pdf
        song-voice.pdf
        ...
```

TODO write more stuff here
